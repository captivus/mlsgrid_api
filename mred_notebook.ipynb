    "# MLSGrid MRED MLS Replication Working Notebook\n",
    "## Objectives & Overview\n",
    "This project will, ultimately, deploy an application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) which accomplishes the following primary objectives.\n",
    "* Replicates the MRED MLS database\n",
    "    1. First in an initial replication and then\n",
    "    1. Maintains an updated replica of the MLS\n",
    "* Provides an API to allow for data analysis using the replica\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional discretionary objectives of this project include:\n",
    "* Publishing an open source Python API wrapper for the MLSGrid API\n",
    "* Publishing an open source Python package to enable the primary objectives of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, as of the time of this project, MLSGrid does not provide any Python enablement of any of this (be it API, SDK, etc...).  Hence, this project is born.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're working through the [MLSGrid documentation](https://docs.mlsgrid.com/api-documentation/api-version-2.0) to build the Python wrapper to the MLSGrid API.  Some important notes as we start.\n",
    "* MLSGrid only provide a replication API, which uses the rather stodgy and seemingly outdated ODATA standard.\n",
    "* MLSGrid's support team seems thinly staffed, which has resulted in a rather \"go it alone\" approach to getting this done."
